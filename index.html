    <p>It was a dark and stormy night. The wind blew loudly and Jon was scared 
      of loud noises. Each bang and bash had him petrified.

    <p> John looked at the queen standing next to her dragon.  
      The dragon was awfully cute, for a dragon. The queen thought so at least. 
      She was fond of her dragons. </p>
